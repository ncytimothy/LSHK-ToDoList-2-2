# LSHK-ToDoList-2-2-19
* We will create our To Do List app from scratch! Don't worry if you don't know how to code in Swift/iOS, we will have a starter project to work on so that we can get up to speed by just writing only a few lines of code! (okay, maybe more than just a few lines)

* [Meetup Link](https://www.meetup.com/Learn-Swift-HK/events/256116526/)

## Getting Started

- Get started with the starter project where will learn step by step on how to build the app!
